**Describe the bug**
A brief description of the bug and what you expected to see.
If it is a crash while loading the game, **attach the crash log** instead of a description.

**To Reproduce**
As short as possible, make sure there are no extra steps.
This can be skipped if your problem is a crash **during loading**.

**System information**
The most important thing is your operating system, game and mod version.
All this information is present in the crash log, so there is no need to duplicate it.

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.
